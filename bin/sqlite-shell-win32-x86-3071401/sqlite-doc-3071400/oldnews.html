<a name="2011__une_28"></a><h3>2011-June-28 - Version 3.7.7.1</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_7_1.html">version 3.7.7.1</a> adds a one-line bug fix to 3.7.7 to fix
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/25ee812710">a problem</a>
  causing <a href="pragma.html#pragma_case_sensitive_like">PRAGMA case_sensitive_like</a> statements compiled using the legacy
  <a href="c3ref/prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare()</a> interface to fail with an <a href="c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_SCHEMA</a> error. Because
  <a href="c3ref/exec.html">sqlite3_exec()</a> uses sqlite3_prepare() internally, the problem also affects
  sqlite3_exec().</p>

<p>  Upgrading from 3.7.7 is only required for applications that use "PRAGMA
  case_sensitive_like" and the sqlite3_prepare() (or sqlite3_exec()) interface.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2011__une_24"></a><h3>2011-June-24 - Version 3.7.7</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_7.html">version 3.7.7</a> is a regularly scheduled bi-monthly maintenance
  release.  Upgrading from version 3.7.6.3 is optional.  Upgrading from all
  prior releases is recommended.</p>

<p>  This release adds support for naming database files using <a href="uri.html">URI filenames</a>.
  URI filenames are disabled by default (for backwards compatibility) but
  applications are encouraged to enable them since incompatibilities are
  likely to be exceedingly rare and the feature is useful.  See the 
  <a href="uri.html">URI filename documentation</a> for details.</p>

<p>  Most of the other enhancements in this release involve 
  <a href="vtab.html">virtual tables</a>.  The virtual table interface has been enhanced to
  support <a href="lang_savepoint.html">SAVEPOINT</a> and <a href="lang_conflict.html">ON CONFLICT</a> clause processing, and the built-in 
  <a href="rtree.html">RTREE</a> and <a href="fts3.html">FTS3/FTS4</a> have been augmented to take advantage of 
  the new capability.  This means, for example, that it is now possible
  to use the <a href="lang_replace.html">REPLACE</a> command on <a href="fts3.html">FTS3/FTS4</a> and <a href="rtree.html">RTREE</a> tables.</p>

<p>  The <a href="fts3.html#fts4">FTS4</a> full-text index extension has been enhanced to support
  the <a href="fts3.html#fts4prefix">FTS4 prefix option</a> and the <a href="fts3.html#fts4order">FTS4 order option</a>.  These two enhancements
  are provided in support of search-as-you-type interfaces where search
  results begin to appear after the first keystroke in the "search" box
  and are refined with each subsequent keystroke.  The way this is done is
  to do a separate full-text search after each key stroke, and add the
  "*" wildcard at the end of the word currently being typed.  So, for
  example, if the text typed so far is "fast da" and the next character
  typed is "t", then the application does a full-text search of the
  pattern "fast dat*" and displays the results.  Such capability has
  always existed.  What is new is that the <a href="fts3.html#fts4prefix">FTS4 prefix option</a> allows
  the search to be very fast (a matter of milliseconds) even for difficult
  cases such as "t*" or "th*".</p>

<p>  There has been a fair amount of work done on the FTS4 module for this
  release.  But the core SQLite code has changed little and the previous
  release has not given any problems, so we expect this to be a very
  stable release.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2011__ay_19"></a><h3>2011-May-19 - Version 3.7.6.3</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_6_3.html">version 3.7.6.3</a> is a patch release that fixes a 
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/2d1a5c67df">single bug</a>
  associated with <a href="wal.html">WAL mode</a>.  The bug has been in SQLite ever since WAL
  was added, but the problem is very obscure and so nobody has noticed
  before now.  Nevertheless, all users are encouraged to upgrade to
  version 3.7.6.3 or later.</p>

<p>  The bug is this:
  If the <a href="pragma.html#pragma_cache_size">cache_size</a> is set very small (less than 10) and SQLite comes
  under memory pressure and if a multi-statement transaction is started
  in which the last statement prior to COMMIT is a SELECT statement and if
  a <a href="wal.html#ckpt">checkpoint</a> occurs right after the transaction commit, then
  it might happen that the transaction will be silently rolled back instead
  of being committed.</p>

<p>  The default setting for <a href="pragma.html#pragma_cache_size">cache_size</a> is 2000. So in most situations, this
  bug will never appear.  But sometimes programmers set <a href="pragma.html#pragma_cache_size">cache_size</a> to
  very small values on gadgets and other low-memory devices in order to
  save memory space.  Such applications are vulnerable.
  Note that this bug does <u>not</u> cause database corruption.  It is
  as if <a href="lang_transaction.html">ROLLBACK</a> were being run instead of <a href="lang_transaction.html">COMMIT</a> in some cases.</p>

<p>  <b>Bug Details</b></p>

<p>  Transactions commit in WAL mode by adding a record onto the end of
  the WAL (the write-ahead log) that contains a "commit" flag.  So to
  commit a transaction, SQLite takes all the pages that have changed
  during that transaction, appends them to the WAL, and sets the commit
  flag on the last page.  Now, if SQLite comes under memory pressure, it
  might try to free up memory space by writing changed pages to the WAL
  prior to the commit.  We call this "spilling" the cache to WAL.  There 
  is nothing wrong with spilling cache to WAL.  But if the
  memory pressure is severe, it might be that by the time <a href="lang_transaction.html">COMMIT</a> is run,
  all changed pages for the transaction have already been spilled to WAL
  and there are no pages left to be written to WAL.
  And with no unwritten pages, there was nothing to put the commit flag
  on.  And without a commit flag, the transaction would end up being
  rolled back.</p>

<p>  The fix to this problem was that if all changed pages has already
  been written to the WAL when the commit was started, then page 1 of
  the database will be written to the WAL again, so that there will always
  be a page available on which to set the commit flag.

  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_6_2.html">version 3.7.6.2</a> adds a one-line bug fix to 3.7.6.1 that enables
  pthreads to work correctly on NetBSD.  The problem was a faulty function
  signature for the open system call.  The problem does not appear to have
  any adverse impact on any system other than NetBSD.</p>

<p>  Upgrading from version 3.7.6.1 is only needed on NetBSD.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2011__pril_13"></a><h3>2011-April-13 - Version 3.7.6.1</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_6_1.html">version 3.7.6.1</a> fixes a single bug in 3.7.6 that can cause a
  segfault if <a href="c3ref/c_fcntl_chunk_size.html#sqlitefcntlsizehint">SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_HINT</a> is used on a unix build that has
  SQLITE_ENABLE_LOCKING_MODE set to 0 and is compiled with
  HAVE_POSIX_FALLOCATE.</p>

<p>  Upgrading from 3.7.6 is only needed for users effected by the 
  configuration-specific bug described above.  There are no other changes
  to the code.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2011__pril_12"></a><h3>2011-April-12 - Version 3.7.6</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_6.html">version 3.7.6</a> is a regularly scheduled bi-monthly maintenance
  release of SQLite.  Upgrading from version 3.7.5 is optional.  Upgrading
  releases prior to 3.7.5 is recommended.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2011__ebruary_01"></a><h3>2011-February-01 - Version 3.7.5</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_5.html">version 3.7.5</a> is a regularly scheduled bi-monthly maintenance
  release of SQLite.  Due to the discovery and fix of 
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/tktview?name=5d863f876e">an obscure bug</a>
  that could cause database corruption, upgrading from all prior
  releases of SQLite is recommended.  This bug was found during code
  review and has not been observed in the wild.</p>

<p>  This release adds new <a href="c3ref/c_dbstatus_options.html#sqlitedbstatuslookasidehit">opcodes</a> for the
  <a href="c3ref/db_status.html">sqlite3_db_status()</a> interface that allow more precise measurement of
  how the <a href="malloc.html#lookaside">lookaside memory allocator</a> is performing, which can be useful
  for tuning in applications with very tight memory constraints.</p>

<p>  The <a href="c3ref/mprintf.html">sqlite3_vsnprintf()</a> interface was added.  This routine is simply
  a varargs version of the long-standing <a href="c3ref/mprintf.html">sqlite3_snprintf()</a> interface.</p>

<p>  The output from <a href="c3ref/profile.html">sqlite3_trace()</a> interface has been enhanced to work
  better (and faster) in systems that use recursive extensions such as
  <a href="fts3.html">FTS3</a> or <a href="rtree.html">RTREE</a>.</p>

<p>  Testing with Valgrind shows that this release of SQLite is about 1%
  or 2% faster than the previous release for most operations.</p>

<p>  A fork of the popular ADO.NET adaptor for SQLite known as System.Data.SQLite
  is now available on <a href="http://System.Data.SQLite.org/">http://System.Data.SQLite.org/</a>.  The originator
  of System.Data.SQLite, Robert Simpson, is aware of this fork, has
  expressed his approval, and has commit privileges on the new Fossil
  repository.  The SQLite development team intends to maintain
  System.Data.SQLite moving forward.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2010__ecember_08"></a><h3>2010-December-08 - Version 3.7.4</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_4.html">version 3.7.4</a> is a regularly scheduled bi-monthly maintenance
  release of SQLite.  Upgrading from <a href="releaselog/3_7_2.html">version 3.7.2</a> and <a href="releaselog/3_7_3.html">version 3.7.3</a>
  is optional.  Upgrading from all other SQLite releases is recommended.</p>

<p>  This release features <a href="fts3.html">full-text search</a> enhancements.  The older 
  <a href="fts3.html">FTS3</a> virtual table is still fully supported, and should also run
  faster.  In addition, the new <a href="fts3.html#fts4">FTS4</a> virtual table is added.  FTS4
  follows the same syntax as FTS3 but holds additional metadata which
  facilitates some performance improvements and more advanced 
  <a href="fts3.html#matchinfo">matchinfo()</a> output.  Look for further full-text search enhancements
  in subsequent releases.</p>

<p>  Also in this release, the <a href="eqp.html">EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN</a> output has been enhanced
  and new documentation is provided so that application developers can
  more easily understand how SQLite is performing their queries.</p>

<p>  Thanks to an account from the folks at <a href="http://www.devio.us/">http://www.devio.us/</a>, OpenBSD
  has been added to the list of platforms upon which we 
  <a href="testing.html">test SQLite</a> prior to every release.  That list of platforms
  now includes:</p>

<p>  <ul>
  <li> Linux x86 &amp; x86_64
  <li> MacOS 10.5 &amp; 10.6
  <li> MacOS 10.2 PowerPC
  <li> WinXP and Win7
  <li> Android 2.2
  <li> OpenBSD 4.7
  </ul></p>

<p>  The previous release of SQLite (<a href="releaselog/3_7_3.html">version 3.7.3</a>) has proven to be very
  robust.  The only serious issue discovered was
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/80ba201079">ticket 80ba201079</a> that
  describes an incorrect query result that can occur under very 
  unusual circumstances.  The ticket description contains details of the
  problem.  Suffice it to say here that the problem is very obscure and
  is unlikely to effect most applications and so upgrading is optional.
  The problem is fixed, of course, in this release.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2010__ctober_08"></a><h3>2010-October-08 - Version 3.7.3</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_3.html">version 3.7.3</a> is a regularly scheduled bi-monthly maintenance
  release of SQLite.  Upgrading from <a href="releaselog/3_7_2.html">version 3.7.2</a> is optional.
  Upgrading from all other releases is recommended.</p>

<p>  This release adds two new interfaces (really just variations on existing
  interfaces).  The <a href="c3ref/create_function.html">sqlite3_create_function_v2()</a> interface adds a 
  destructor for the application-data pointer.  The new 
  <a href="c3ref/soft_heap_limit64.html">sqlite3_soft_heap_limit64()</a> interface allows the soft heap limit to
  be set to a value greater than 2<sup>31</sup>. </p>

<p>  The <a href="rtree.html">RTREE</a> extension has been enhanced with the ability to have an
  <a href="rtree.html#customquery">application-defined query region</a>.  This might
  be used, for example, to locate all objects within 
  the field of view of a camera.</p>

<p>  The 3.7.3 release also includes some performance enhancements, including
  query planner improvements, documentation updates,
  and fixes to some very obscure bugs.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2010__ugust_24"></a><h3>2010-August-24 - Version 3.7.2</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_2.html">version 3.7.2</a> fixes a long-standing bug that can cause the
  database <a href="fileformat2.html#freelist">free-page list</a> to go corrupt if <a href="pragma.html#pragma_incremental_vacuum">incremental_vacuum</a> is used
  multiple times to
  partially reduce the size of a database file that contains many hundreds
  of unused database pages.  The original bug reports together with links
  to the patch that fixes it can be seen 
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/5e10420e8d">here</a>.</p>

<p>  This bug has been in the code for at least a year and possibly longer.
  The bug has nothing to do with the versions 3.7.1 or 3.7.0 or any other
  recent release.  The fact that the bug was discovered (and fixed)
  within hours of the 3.7.1 release is purely a coincidence.</p>

<p>  The bug is impossible to hit without using <a href="pragma.html#pragma_incremental_vacuum">incremental_vacuum</a> and is
  very difficult to hit even with incremental_vacuum.  And the kind of
  corruption that the bug causes can usually be fixed 
  simply by running <a href="lang_vacuum.html">VACUUM</a>.  Nevertheless, because the bug can result
  in database corruption, it is recommended that all SQLite users upgrade
  to version 3.7.2 or later.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2010__ugust_23"></a><h3>2010-August-23 - Version 3.7.1</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_1.html">version 3.7.1</a> is a stabilization release for the 3.7.x series.
  Other than the filesize-in-header bug that was fixed in <a href="releaselog/3_7_0_1.html">version 3.7.0.1</a>,
  no major problems have been seen in 3.7.0.  Some minor corner-case
  performance regressions have been fixed.  A typo in the OS/2 interface
  has been repaired.</p>

<p>  A biggest part of the 3.7.1 release is a cleanup and refactoring of
  the pager module within SQLite.  This refactoring should have no
  application-visible effects.  The purpose was to reorganize the code
  in ways that make it easier to prove correctness.</p>

<p>  The 3.7.1 release adds new experimental methods for obtained more 
  detailed memory usage information and for controlling database file
  fragmentation.  And the query planner now does a better job of
  optimizing the <a href="lang_expr.html#like">LIKE</a> and <a href="lang_expr.html#glob">GLOB</a> operators.</p>

<p>  This release increases the maximum size of database pages from 32KiB to
  64KiB.  A database with 64KiB pages will not be readable or writable by
  older versions of SQLite.  Note that further increases in page size
  are not feasible since the <a href="fileformat2.html">file format</a> uses 16-bit offsets to structures
  within each page.

  filesize-in-header feature of the <a href="fileformat2.html">SQLite file format</a>
  that could cause database corruption if the same database file is
  written alternately with version 3.7.0 and version 3.6.23.1 or earlier.
  A performance regression was also fixed in this release.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2010__uly_22"></a><h3>2010-July-22 - Version 3.7.0</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_7_0.html">version 3.7.0</a> is a major release of SQLite that features
  a new transaction control mechanism using a <a href="wal.html">write-ahead log</a> or <a href="wal.html">WAL</a>.
  The traditional rollback-journal is still used as the default so there
  should be no visible change for legacy programs.  But newer programs
  can take advantage of improved performance and concurrency by enabling
  the WAL journaling mode.</p>

<p>  SQLite version 3.7.0 also contains some query planner enhancements and
  a few obscure bug fixes, but the only really big change is the addition
  of WAL mode.

  <li> Ticket <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/eb5548a849">eb5548a849</a>

  a problem where the use of the CAST operator in the WHERE clause can lead
  to incorrect results if the column being cast to a new datatype is also
  used in the same WHERE clause without being cast.
  </ul>
  Both bugs are obscure,
  but because they could arise in an application after deployment, it is
  recommended that all applications upgrade SQLite to version 3.6.22.</p>

<p>  This release also includes other minor bug fixes and performance
  enhancements, especially in the <a href="fts3.html">FTS3</a> extension.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2009__ec_07"></a><h3>2009-Dec-07 - Version 3.6.21</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_21.html">version 3.6.21</a> focuses on performance optimization.  For
  a certain set of traces, this version uses 12% fewer CPU instructions
  than the previous release (as measured by Valgrind).  In addition, the
  <a href="fts3.html">FTS3</a> extension has been through an extensive cleanup and rework and
  the <a href="c3ref/profile.html">sqlite3_trace()</a> interface has been modified to insert 
  <a href="lang_expr.html#varparam">bound parameter</a> values into its output.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2009__ov_04"></a><h3>2009-Nov-04 - Version 3.6.20</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_20.html">version 3.6.20</a> is a general maintenance release.  The
  query planner has been enhanced to work better with bound parameters
  in LIKE and GLOB operators and in range constraints and various minor
  bugs have been fixed.  Upgrading from 3.6.19 is optional.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2009__ct_14"></a><h3>2009-Oct-14 - Version 3.6.19</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_19.html">version 3.6.19</a> adds native support for
  <a href="foreignkeys.html">foreign key constraints</a>, including deferred constraints and
  cascading deletes.  Enforcement of foreign keys is disabled by
  default for backwards compatibility and must be turned on using
  the <a href="pragma.html#pragma_foreign_keys">foreign_keys pragma</a>.</p>

<p>  Version 3.6.19 also adds support for the
  <a href="lang_expr.html#isisnot">IS and IS NOT operators</a>.  Formerly, SQLite (as most
  other SQL database engines) supported IS NULL and IS NOT NULL.  The
  IS and IS NOT operators are generalizations that allow the right-hand
  side to be an arbitrary expression.  IS and IS NOT work the same as
  == (equals) and != (not equals) except that with IS and IS NOT the
  NULL values compare equal to one another.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2009__ep_11"></a><h3>2009-Sep-11 - Version 3.6.18</h3><blockquote>
  Beginning with this release, the SQLite source code is tracked and
  managed using the <a href="http://www.fossil-scm.org/">Fossil</a>
  distributed configuration management system.  SQLite was previously
  versioned using CVS.  The entire CVS history has been imported into
  Fossil.  The older CVS repository remains on the website but is
  read-only.</p>

<p>  There are two major enhancements in SQLite version 3.6.18.  The first
  is a series or refinements to the query planner that help SQLite to
  choose better plans for joins where in the past it was selecting suboptimal
  query plans.  The <a href="compile.html#enable_stat2">SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT2</a> compile-time option has been
  added to cause SQLite to collect histogram data on indices when the
  <a href="lang_analyze.html">ANALYZE</a> command is run.  The use of histograms improve the query
  planning performance even more.</p>

<p>  The second major enhancement is that SQLite now support recursive
  triggers.  The older non-recursive behavior of triggers is still the
  default behavior.  Recursive triggers are activated using the
  <a href="pragma.html#pragma_recursive_triggers">recursive_triggers pragma</a>.  In addition to allowing triggers to
  call themselves (either directly or indirectly) the new capability
  also fires DELETE triggers on rows that are removed from a table
  as a result of <a href="lang_conflict.html">REPLACE</a> conflict resolution processing.</p>

<p>  Non-recursive triggers are still the default behavior since this
  is least likely to cause problems for existing applications.  However,
  we anticipate that triggers will become
  recursive by default beginning with release 3.7.0.  At that point,
  applications that want to continue using the older non-recursive
  trigger behavior will need to use the <a href="pragma.html#pragma_recursive_triggers">recursive_triggers pragma</a>
  to disable recursive triggers.</p>

<p>  This version of SQLite also contains bug fixes, though none of the
  bugs are serious and all are obscure, so upgrading is optional.</p>

<p>  The SQLite core continues to have <a href="testing.html#coverage">100% branch test coverage</a>
  and so despite the many changes in this release, the developers 
  believe that this version of SQLite is stable and ready for production
  use.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2009__ug_10"></a><h3>2009-Aug-10 - Version 3.6.17</h3><blockquote>
  This is a monthly maintenance release with a focus of bug fixes,
  performance improvements, and increased test coverage.  This is the
  first release of SQLite since <a href="testing.html#coverage">100% branch test coverage</a>
  was achieved on the SQLite core.  </p>

<p>  In addition, a new interface <a href="c3ref/stricmp.html">sqlite3_strnicmp()</a> is provided for the
  convenience of extension writers.</p>

<p>  None of the bugs fixed in this release are serious.  All bugs are
  obscure.  Upgrading is optional.

  A subset of the <a href="th3.html">TH3</a> test suite was measured by gcov to provide
  <a href="testing.html#coverage">100% branch test coverage</a> over the SQLite core
  (exclusive of the VFS backend and of extensions such as FTS3 and RTREE)
  when compiled for SuSE 10.1 Linux on x86.  The SQLite developers pledge
  to maintain branch test coverage at 100% in all future releases.
  Ongoing work will strive for 100% branch test coverage on the 
  operating-system backends and extensions as well.

  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_16.html">version 3.6.16</a> is another general maintenance release containing
  performance and robustness enhancements.  A single notable bug was fixed
  (ticket #3929).  This bug cause cause INSERT or UPDATE statements to fail
  on indexed tables that have AFTER triggers that modify the same table and
  index.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2009__un_15"></a><h3>2009-Jun-15 - Version 3.6.15</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_15.html">version 3.6.15</a> is a general maintenance release containing
  performance and robustness enhancements and fixes for various obscure
  bugs.  
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2009__ay_25"></a><h3>2009-May-25 - Version 3.6.14.2</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_14_2.html">version 3.6.14.2</a> fixes an obscure bug in the code generator
  (<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=3879">ticket #3879</a>)
  section of SQLite which can potentially cause incorrect query results.
  The changes from the prior release consist of only this one bug fix,
  check-in <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/chngview?cn=6676">[6676]</a>
  and a change to the version number text.</p>

<p>  The bug was introduced in version 3.6.14.  It is recommended that
  users of version 3.6.14 and 3.6.14.1 upgrade to this release.  Applications
  are unlikely to hit this bug, but since it is difficult to predict which
  applications might hit it and which might not, we recommend that all
  users of 3.6.14 and 3.5.14.1 upgrade to this release.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2009__ay_19"></a><h3>2009-May-19 - Version 3.6.14.1</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_14_1.html">version 3.6.14.1</a> is a patch release to <a href="releaselog/3_6_14.html">version 3.6.14</a> with
  minimal changes that fixes three bugs.  Upgrading is only necessary 
  for users who are impacted by one or more of those bugs.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2009__ay_07"></a><h3>2009-May-07 - Version 3.6.14</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_14.html">version 3.6.14</a> provides new performance enhancements in
  the btree and pager layers and in the query optimizer.  Certain
  workloads can be as much as twice as fast as the previous release,
  though 10% faster is a more typical result.</p>

<p>  Queries against <a href="vtab.html">virtual tables</a> that contain OR and IN operators
  in the WHERE clause are now able to use indexing.</p>

<p>  A new optional <a href="asyncvfs.html">asynchronous I/O backend</a> is available for
  unix and windows.  The asynchronous backend gives the illusion of faster
  response time by pushing slow write operations into a background thread.
  The tradeoff for faster response time is that more memory is required
  (to hold the content of the pending writes) and if a power failure or
  program crash occurs, some transactions that appeared to have committed
  might end up being rolled back upon restart.</p>

<p>  This release also contains many minor bug fixes, documentation enhancements,
  new test cases, and cleanups and simplifications to the source code.</p>

<p>  There is no compelling reason to upgrade from versions 3.6.12 or
  3.6.13 if those prior versions are working.  Though many users may
  benefit from the improved performance.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2008__ec_16"></a><h3>2008-Dec-16 - Version 3.6.7</h3><blockquote>
  SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_7.html">version 3.6.7</a> contains a major cleanup of the Unix driver,
  and support for the new Proxy Locking mechanism on Mac OS X.  Though
  the Unix driver is reorganized, its functionality is the same and so
  applications should not notice a difference.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2008__ov_26"></a><h3>2008-Nov-26 - Version 3.6.6.2</h3><blockquote>
  This release fixes a bug that was introduced into SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_6.html">version 3.6.6</a>
  and which seems like it might be able to cause database corruption.  This
  bug was detected during stress testing.  It has not been seen in the wild.
  An analysis of the problem suggests that the bug might be able to cause
  database corruption, however focused efforts to find a real-world test
  cases that actually causes database corruption have so far been unsuccessful.
  Hence, the likelihood of this bug causing problems is low.  Nevertheless,
  we have decided to do an emergency branch release out of an abundance of
  caution.</p>

<p>  The <a href="releaselog/3_6_6_2.html">version 3.6.6.2</a> release also fixes an obscure memory leak that
  can occur following a disk I/O error.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2008__ov_22"></a><h3>2008-Nov-22 - Version 3.6.6.1</h3><blockquote>
  This release fixes a bug that was introduced into SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_6_4.html">version 3.6.4</a>
  and that can cause database corruption in obscure cases.  This bug has
  never been seen in the wild; it was first detected by internal stress
  tests and required substantial analysis before it could be shown to 
  potentially lead to corruption.  So we feel that SQLite versions 3.6.4,
  3.6.5, and 3.6.6 are safe to use for development work.  But upgrading
  to this patch release or later is recommended prior to deploying
  products that incorporate SQLite.</p>

<p>  We have taken the unusual step of issuing a patch release in order to
  get the fix for this bug into circulation quickly.  SQLite version 3.6.7
  will continue on its normal path of development with an anticipated
  release in mid December.

  There are potential incompatibilities with some legacy applications.
  See the <a href="35to36.html">35to36.html</a> document for details.</p>

<p>  Many new interfaces are introduced in version 3.6.0.  The code is
  very well tested and is appropriate for use in stable systems.  We
  have attached the "beta" designation only so that we can make tweaks to
  the new interfaces in the next release without having to declare an
  incompatibility.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2008__ay_12"></a><h3>2008-May-12 - Version 3.5.9</h3><blockquote>
  Version 3.5.9 adds a new experimental <a href="pragma.html#syntax">PRAGMA</a>: <a href="pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode">journal_mode</a>.
  Setting the journal mode to PERSIST can provide performance improvement
  on systems where deleting a file is expensive.  The PERSIST journal
  mode is still considered experimental and should be used with caution
  pending further testing.</p>

<p>  Version 3.5.9 is intended to be the last stable release prior to
  version 3.6.0.  Version 3.6.0 will make incompatible changes to the
  <a href="c3ref/vfs.html">sqlite3_vfs</a> VFS layer in order to address deficiencies in the original
  design.  These incompatibilities will only effect programmers who
  write their own custom VFS layers (typically embedded device builders).

  Version 3.5.5 changes over 8% of the core source code of SQLite in order
  to convert the internal virtual machine from a stack-based design into
  a register-based design.  This change will allow future optimizations
  and will avoid an entire class of stack overflow bugs that have caused
  problems in the past.  Even though this change is large, extensive testing

  APIs are subject to change in a future release.  This release is
  mostly to make available the minor bug fixes that have accumulated
  since 3.3.6.  Upgrading is not necessary.  Do so only if you encounter
  one of the obscure bugs that have been fixed or if you want to try
  out the new features.

  Many bugs found in last week's alpha release have now been fixed and
  the library is running much faster again.</p>

<p>  Database connections can now be moved between threads as long as the
  connection holds no locks at the time it is moved.  Thus the common
  paradigm of maintaining a pool of database connections and handing
  them off to transient worker threads is now supported.
  Please help test this new feature.
  See <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=MultiThreading">

  Version 3.3.0 adds support for CHECK constraints, DESC indices,
  separate REAL and INTEGER column affinities, a new OS interface layer
  design, and many other changes.  The code passed a regression
  test but should still be considered alpha.  Please report any
  problems.</p>

<p>  The file format for version 3.3.0 has changed slightly to support
  descending indices and
  a more efficient encoding of boolean values.  SQLite 3.3.0 will read and
  write legacy databases created with any prior version of SQLite 3.  But
  databases created by version 3.3.0 will not be readable or writable
  by earlier versions of the SQLite.  The older file format can be
  specified at compile-time for those rare cases where it is needed.

  These versions contain one-line changes to 3.2.7 and 2.8.16 to fix a bug
  that has been present since March of 2002 and version 2.4.0.
  That bug might possibly cause database corruption if a large INSERT or
  UPDATE statement within a multi-statement transaction fails due to a
  uniqueness constraint but the containing transaction commits.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2005__ep_24"></a><h3>2005-Sep-24 - Version 3.2.7</h3><blockquote>

</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2005__ep_16"></a><h3>2005-Sep-16 - Version 3.2.6 - Critical Bug Fix</h3><blockquote>
  This version fixes a bug that can result in database
  corruption if a VACUUM of a 1 gigabyte or larger database fails
  (perhaps do to running out of disk space or an unexpected power loss)
  and is later rolled back.
  <p>
  Also in this release:
  The ORDER BY and GROUP BY processing was rewritten to use less memory.
  Support for COUNT(DISTINCT) was added.  The LIKE operator can now be
  used by the optimizer on columns with COLLATE NOCASE.

  The new ADD COLUMN capability is made
  possible by AOL developers supporting and embracing great

<p>  Version 3.2.0 also fixes an obscure but serious bug that was discovered
  just prior to release.  If you have a multi-statement transaction and
  within that transaction an UPDATE or INSERT statement fails due to a
  constraint, then you try to rollback the whole transaction, the rollback
  might not work correctly.  See
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=1171">Ticket #1171</a>

  Version 3.1.6 fixes a critical bug that can cause database corruption
  when inserting rows into tables with around 125 columns. This bug was
  introduced in version 3.0.0.  See
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=1163">Ticket #1163</a>
  for additional information.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2005__ar_11"></a><h3>2005-Mar-11 - Versions 3.1.4 and 3.1.5 Released</h3><blockquote>
  Version 3.1.4 fixes a critical bug that could cause database corruption
  if the autovacuum mode of version 3.1.0 is turned on (it is off by
  default) and a CREATE UNIQUE INDEX is executed within a transaction but
  fails because the indexed columns are not unique.  Anyone using the
  autovacuum feature and unique indices should upgrade.</p>

<p>  Version 3.1.5 adds the ability to disable
  the F_FULLFSYNC ioctl() in OS-X by setting "PRAGMA synchronous=on" instead
  of the default "PRAGMA synchronous=full".  There was an attempt to add
  this capability in 3.1.4 but it did not work due to a spelling error.

  A critical bug in the VACUUM command that can lead to database
  corruption has been fixed in both the 2.x branch and the main
  3.x line.  This bug has existed in all prior versions of SQLite.

  A new file format results in databases that are 25% smaller (depending
