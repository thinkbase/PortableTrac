Mini Server 1 is a free product and does not contain commercial software!
You can use it for free. - No installation required!

This server is portable meaning you can run it from any folder on any hard drive or
copy all the files to a USB memory stick and run it from there. 

-------------------
Starting the server
-------------------
Run Server by double clicking on server_start.bat this creates a virtual drive.
The drive letter used is the first available letter found.
Server uses the port 8081

Type http://localhost:8081 into a browser to view the site.

------------------------
Shutting down the server
------------------------
Double click on server_stop.bat. This shuts-down server and removes virtual drive

---------------------
Change virtual drive
---------------------
The server automatically detects the first free drive letter and uses that.
You can override this in one of two ways:

a) Start the server using a drive parameter for example:
   server_start.bat z
   this forces the server to use drive z

b) Edit server_start.bat
   Locate the following line:
    rem set Disk=w 
   Remove the rem and replace w with the letter you want to use.
   Example:
   set Disk=x
   Forces the server to use drive letter x

--------------------------
Change server default port
--------------------------
Open file: httpd.conf
Located in folder: \mini_server_1\udrive\usr\local\apache2\conf
Locate the lines:
  Listen 8081 
  ServerName localhost:8081
Change to:
  Listen 8080 
  ServerName localhost:8080
This moves the server to the standard secondary web server port
Note: Type http://localhost:8080 into a browser to view the site.

If port already in use try any value above 2000

----------------------
Running multi-servers
----------------------
To run multi Apache servers:

1) Create a new folder and copy the contents from server 1 into it.
2) Each server must have a unique port. Change port as above.

Note: You can run the mini servers alongside Uniform Server 3.5-Apollo
      make sure to start Uniform Server first.
